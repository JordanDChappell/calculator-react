# React Calculator

Have you ever thought to yourself "I want to see yet another calculator application?", No? Well tough luck.

Take a look through the most basic of applications and see the secrets unfold before your eyes.

### Structure
All code relevant files are in the `./codebase` directory by default, this is, in my opinion, a great way to separate config (`.vscode`, `.github`, `README.md`, etc) and code files.

### Quick Start
The following commands will get you up and running, ready to make changes to your new React application:

```
cd codebase
yarn install
yarn start
```

You'll be installing project dependencies using yarn, and running a simple script found in the `./codebase/package.json` file to start the Parcel bundler in `watch` mode, repackaging the app as source files are updated.
